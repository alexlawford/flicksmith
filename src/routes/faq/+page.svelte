            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h2>Do I have to Pay?</h2>
            <p>You only have to pay for film production, not for receiving a pitch.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve chosen a director, you can sign a contract to begin production of your video/film. Typically, film production will require half of the budget up front and half on delivery.</p>
            <h2>Do You Always Deliver Pitches/Treatments?</h2>
            <p>Not always. Sometimes, briefs are unrealistic &mdash; for example, if you’re envisaging a large cast, lots of exotic locations and some VFX, but you have a relatively modest budget, we may advise you rethink your direction instead.</p>
            <p>We also may get in touch to make sure you are serious about making the project, as creating pitches is time-consuming.</p>
            <h2>What if I Don’t Know Some of the Answers to the Questions in the Questionairre?</h2>
            <p>Just let us know in the text description at the end. It’s not unsusal to not know how many locations you want, for example &mdash; so just pick your best guess at let us know you are open to discuss those kind of details as we go.</p>
            <h2>Who Owns the Copyright to the Pitch?</h2>
            <p>Once a pitch is prepared, you’ll be asked to agree that the ownership of the ideas, plans, and work product presented during the course of a pitch belongs to the director who created it. Of course, you’ll have the rights to use any film you make with that director based on their pitch, for whatever purpose(s) you agree to.</p>
